# RockPaperScissors

Simple game which allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

Skills I learnt:
- Linking an external JavaScript file to the HTML file.
- Taking input from a user and validating it against our check function.
- Setting up rules to allow the user to enter shortcut (using 'R' instead of typing rock).
- Converting input to lower case to make it easier to validate the input.
- Checking error messages in the console to locate Type and Syntax errors.
